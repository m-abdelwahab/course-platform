> üëâ I go over the details of why and how I built this demo during my talk, presented at Next.js conf 2021.


> ‚ö†Ô∏è This repo + README are a work in progress. I plan to maintain this example and add more features over time. If you see any room for improvement, feel free to submit a PR üòÑ


Live demo: https://epic-course-platform.vercel.app/

## Tech Stack

Course Platform template built using the following tools:
- Next.js (fullstack React framework)
- next-mdx-remote (Add support for MDX when using Next.js)
- next-auth (authentication for Next.js apps)
- Prisma (Next-gen ORM for Node.js & TypeScript)
- PlanetScale (Serverless MySQL Database)
- TailwindCSS (Styling)
- Vercel (Deployment)
- SendGrid (Sending emails)
- TypeScript

## Why this stack

This stack is awesome for the following reasons:
- Make fewer errors when using TypeScript and you also get zer-cost type-safe database access when using Prisma
- All tools offer fantastic developer experience
- All of the tools have great developer communities
- All of these tools allow you to easily scale (Vercel + PlanetScale)

## Setting up the project 

To set up the project locally, run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/m-abdelwahab/course-platform.git

cd course-platform

npm install

npm run dev
```

This will install the project and start a local development server at [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000).

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure you've nodejs version ^12.19.0 or ^14.15.0 or ^16.13.0", cause those are the only versions supported by next-auth@beta otherwise you'll get ```"next-auth/react" module not found``` error when you run the app

> ‚ùóÔ∏è Make sure your rename the `.env.example` to `.env`
### Setting up the database

To set up a database on PlanetScale, check out this detailed [guide](https://docs.planetscale.com/tutorials/automatic-prisma-migrations), which goes over how to work with PlanetScale and Prisma.

### Setting up an email sending service

I'm using SendGrid. Hee's what you need to do to get started:

First, create an account and setup a sender email for testing your integration.

After that, go to the Integration Guide in the Email API dropdown on the left sidebar. Next, pick SMTP relay

Finally, create an API key and add the following variables to your `.env` file
 

```bash
EMAIL_SERVER_USER= 'apikey'
EMAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD= 'YOUR_PASSWORD'
EMAIL_SERVER_HOST= 'smtp.sendgrid.net'
EMAIL_SERVER_PORT= '587'
EMAIL_FROM = 'your-sender-email@example.com'
```

### Setting up Stripe Checkout

Creating an account at stripe.com and login into your dashboard. Next, go to the products tab and add a product

![Add product](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27310414/138911182-2648f9b6-7e10-479f-836c-cb5376b129c9.png)


After that, go to the product details page by clicking on the product from the product list and grab the `API ID` from the pricing section and include it in the `/api/checkout` file

![pick PriceId from product settings](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27310414/138911339-2c10bcc4-240a-42e0-a329-3bd4e0f2daaa.png)



Finally, to add support for webhooks, go to the "Developers tab" and click "add endpoint".

![Webhooks](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27310414/138911455-e31805e0-e0ab-4a49-aefd-1be8e97f55f8.png)

You can test in a local environment using Stripe's CLI by forwarding events to your webhooks and triggering a `charge.succeeded` event.

<img width="1920" alt="Setting up a webhook endpoint" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27310414/138911561-7f2c63b8-f78b-4be0-a978-c2fbf7b28957.png">


```
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhook

stripe trigger charge.succeeded

```

If you followed all the previous steps correctly, you should see a newly added user in your database, while listening to the `charge.succeeded` event.


For production, you need to set the endpoint URL to `domain-of-your-deployment/api/webhook` and select the `charge.succeeded` event. Finally, you need to grab the signing secret, which will be set to the `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` when deploying to Vercel.

![Webhook secret](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27310414/138911739-8e2387e1-5a94-4407-8e02-30621f2c4881.png)
